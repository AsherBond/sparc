```

- `src/` contains the application source code, organized into directories for controllers, models, routes, services, and utilities.
- `tests/` contains unit, integration, and performance test suites.
- `docs/` contains API documentation and architectural diagrams.
- `config/` contains configuration files for different environments (development, production, test).
- `.env` is a file for storing environment variables.
- `.eslintrc.js` is a configuration file for ESLint.
- `.gitignore` specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `package.json` is the Node.js package manifest file.
- `README.md` is the project's main documentation file.

### Development Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Install Node.js and a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
   - Initialize a new Node.js project and install required dependencies (e.g., Express.js, Sqlite3).
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting.
   - Configure Git for version control.

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Define data models and create SQLite database schema.
   - Implement CRUD operations for managing entities (e.g., users, products, orders).
   - Create RESTful API routes and controllers.
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT).
   - Integrate input validation and sanitization.
   - Implement logging and error handling.

3. **Testing**
   - Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
   - Write unit tests for individual components (models, services, utilities).
   - Create integration tests for API routes and database interactions.
   - Implement performance tests to measure application performance under load.
   - Set up continuous integration (CI) with a service like Travis CI or GitHub Actions.

4. **Documentation**
   - Document the API using a tool like Swagger or API Blueprint.
   - Create architectural diagrams and document the system's design decisions.
   - Update the `README.md` file with project setup instructions, usage examples, and other relevant information.

5. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Set up a production environment (e.g., cloud hosting, virtual private server).
   - Configure environment variables for production.
   - Implement logging and monitoring solutions (e.g., Morgan, Winston, Prometheus).
   - Set up a process manager like PM2 or systemd for managing the Node.js application.
   - Implement a load balancer or reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) for handling incoming requests.
   - Set up SSL/TLS for secure communication.

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**
  - Test individual components (models, services, utilities) in isolation.
  - Achieve at least 80% code coverage for critical parts of the application.
  - Use test mocking and stubbing when necessary.

- **Integration Tests**
  - Test API routes and database interactions.
  - Ensure data consistency and integrity across multiple components.
  - Test authentication and authorization mechanisms.

- **Performance Tests**
  - Use a tool like Apache JMeter or k6 to simulate load on the application.
  - Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization under different load scenarios.
  - Set performance benchmarks based on expected user traffic and system requirements.

- **Security Tests**
  - Test for common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
  - Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
  - Implement security best practices (e.g., input validation, secure headers, secure cookies).

### Deployment Considerations

- **Environment Configuration**
  - Set up environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `config/production.js`).
  - Use environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
  - Consider using a configuration management tool like Ansible or Terraform for provisioning and managing infrastructure.

- **Dependencies**
  - Use a package manager (e.g., npm or yarn) to manage project dependencies.
  - Keep dependencies up-to-date and regularly check for security vulnerabilities.
  - Consider using a tool like Snyk or npm audit for automated dependency vulnerability scanning.

- **Monitoring**
  - Set up monitoring solutions for application performance, system health, and error logging.
  - Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog for monitoring and alerting.
  - Implement application-level metrics and health checks.

- **Maintenance**
  - Plan for regular software updates and security patches.
  - Implement a backup and disaster recovery strategy.
  - Automate deployment processes using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
  - Implement a feature flag system for controlled rollouts and feature toggles.
