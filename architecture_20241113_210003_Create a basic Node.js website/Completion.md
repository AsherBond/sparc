# SPARC Architecture Documentation

## Completion Criteria

### Project Structure

1. **Source Code Organization**
   - Follow a modular structure with separate directories for routes, controllers, views, and utilities.
   - Use a consistent naming convention for files and directories.
   - Maintain a clear separation of concerns between different components.

2. **Configuration Files**
   - Create a dedicated configuration file (e.g., `config.js`) to manage environment-specific settings, such as the server port, database connection details, and other relevant configurations.
   - Utilize environment variables for sensitive information and configurations that may vary across different environments.

3. **Documentation**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation for the project, including an overview, installation guide, usage instructions, and API reference (if applicable).
   - Use a standard documentation format, such as Markdown or a dedicated documentation tool.

4. **Test Suite**
   - Set up a test directory structure to organize unit tests, integration tests, and other test types.
   - Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha for writing and running tests.
   - Implement test cases for critical components, including routes, controllers, and utility functions.

### Development Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Install Node.js and a package manager (e.g., npm or yarn) on the development machine.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project and set up the project structure.
   - Install required dependencies, such as Express.js for the web server and any other necessary libraries or middleware.

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Set up the Express.js server and define routes for the home page and about page.
   - Create the corresponding controller functions to handle the routes and render the views.
   - Develop the views using a templating engine like EJS or Handlebars, or use static HTML files.
   - Implement any additional features or functionality as required.

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for the routes, controllers, and utility functions.
   - Implement integration tests to ensure the correct behavior of the application when components are combined.
   - Consider adding performance tests to measure the application's responsiveness and identify potential bottlenecks.
   - Conduct security testing to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

4. **Documentation**
   - Document the project structure, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
   - Provide API documentation (if applicable) for any exposed endpoints or services.
   - Include information about the project's dependencies and their versions.

5. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Configure the application for the target deployment environment (e.g., production, staging).
   - Set up environment variables or configuration files for the deployment environment.
   - Optimize the application for production by minifying assets, enabling caching, and applying any necessary performance optimizations.

### Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components, such as routes, controllers, and utility functions, in isolation.
   - Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha to write and run unit tests.
   - Aim for high code coverage and ensure that all critical code paths are tested.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the interaction between different components of the application.
   - Simulate real-world scenarios by combining multiple components and testing their collective behavior.
   - Use tools like Supertest or a browser automation tool like Puppeteer for end-to-end testing.

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Measure the application's performance under different load conditions.
   - Use tools like Apache JMeter or k6 to simulate concurrent user requests and analyze the application's response times and resource utilization.
   - Identify and address performance bottlenecks, if any.

4. **Security Tests**
   - Conduct security testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application.
   - Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to perform security testing, including testing for common web application vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection.
   - Implement countermeasures and security best practices to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.

### Deployment Considerations

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up the deployment environment with the required dependencies and configurations.
   - Configure environment variables or configuration files specific to the deployment environment.
   - Ensure that sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys, is securely stored and accessed.

2. **Dependencies**
   - Manage project dependencies using a package manager like npm or yarn.
   - Lock dependency versions to ensure consistent behavior across different environments.
   - Consider using a dependency management tool like Snyk or npm audit to identify and address security vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

3. **Monitoring**
   - Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the application's performance and identify issues.
   - Use tools like PM2 or forever to keep the Node.js process running and monitor its health.
   - Configure logging to capture relevant information, such as errors, warnings, and performance metrics.

4. **Maintenance**
   - Establish a process for regularly updating dependencies and addressing security vulnerabilities.
   - Implement a deployment strategy that minimizes downtime and ensures a smooth transition between versions.
   - Regularly review and update the application's documentation to reflect any changes or updates.
