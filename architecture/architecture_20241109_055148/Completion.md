**Technology Stack**

- Framework/Runtime: Spring Boot (Java)
- Language: Java
- Features:
  - REST API with Spring MVC
  - Data persistence with Spring Data JPA
  - Authentication and authorization with Spring Security
  - Caching with Spring Cache
  - Asynchronous processing with Spring Task Scheduler
  - External API integration
  - Logging with SLF4J and Logback
  - Unit testing with JUnit and Mockito
  - Integration testing with TestContainers
  - Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions
  - Containerization with Docker

**Best Practices and Patterns**

- Follow the principles of Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture
- Separate concerns using layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
- Use dependency injection with Spring's IoC container
- Implement domain-driven design patterns (Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates)
- Use DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern for data transfer between layers
- Implement SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)
- Use design patterns like Factory, Builder, Adapter, Facade, and Strategy where appropriate
- Implement proper error handling and exception management
- Follow RESTful API design principles (resource-oriented URLs, HTTP methods, status codes)
- Implement caching strategies (in-memory, distributed) for performance optimization
- Use asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Implement security best practices (input validation, encryption, access control)
- Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests
- Implement logging and monitoring for better observability
- Follow coding standards and conventions (naming, formatting, comments)
- Containerize the application for consistent deployment across environments
- Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline for automated builds and deployments
- Document the architecture, APIs, and deployment instructions

This structure and set of best practices will help you build a robust, maintainable, and scalable application following industry-standard practices.
