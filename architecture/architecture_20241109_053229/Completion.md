Completion Criteria:

1. **Functional Requirements:**
   - Define the key functional requirements for the project based on the business needs and user stories.
   - Ensure that all functional requirements are clearly documented and understood by the development team.

2. **Non-Functional Requirements:**
   - Identify and document the non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, scalability, and maintainability.
   - Define acceptance criteria for each non-functional requirement.

3. **Test Cases:**
   - Develop comprehensive test cases covering all functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Ensure that test cases are well-documented and cover different scenarios, including positive and negative cases.

4. **Code Review:**
   - Establish a code review process to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards and best practices.
   - Define criteria for code review, such as code readability, maintainability, and performance.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Create detailed technical documentation, including architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, and API documentation.
   - Ensure that the documentation is up-to-date and easily accessible to the development team and stakeholders.

6. **Deployment and Release:**
   - Define the deployment and release process, including environments (e.g., development, staging, production), deployment strategies, and rollback procedures.
   - Ensure that the deployment process is automated and repeatable.

7. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the application's performance, errors, and usage patterns.
   - Define monitoring and logging requirements, such as log levels, retention periods, and alerting mechanisms.

8. **Security:**
   - Identify and address potential security vulnerabilities in the application and infrastructure.
   - Implement security best practices, such as input validation, encryption, and secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

9. **Performance Testing:**
   - Conduct performance testing to ensure that the application meets the defined performance requirements under various load conditions.
   - Define performance testing scenarios and acceptance criteria.

10. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    - Involve end-users or stakeholders in the testing process to validate that the application meets their requirements and expectations.
    - Define UAT scenarios and acceptance criteria.
