Here is a detailed software specification for a test project:

# Test Project Software Specification

## Overview
This project is for creating a test application to validate software testing practices and methodologies. The application will simulate common web application functionality to allow for different types of testing to be performed.

## Technology Stack
- Framework/Runtime: Node.js
- Language: JavaScript
- Features: 
  - Web Server (Express.js)
  - Data Storage (MongoDB)
  - Authentication (JWT)
  - API (REST)
  - Frontend (React)

## Architecture
The application will follow a standard 3-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Tier**: React frontend to render the UI and handle user interactions.
2. **Application Tier**: Node.js/Express.js backend to handle business logic, API, and integration with data store. 
3. **Data Tier**: MongoDB database to store application data.

## Code Structure 
The code will be organized using a modular, domain-driven design approach:

```
src/
  client/       # React frontend  
  server/       # Node/Express backend
    controllers/
    models/
    routes/
    services/
    utils/
  shared/       # Shared code between client/server
test/           # Test suite
```

## Design Patterns
The following design patterns will be used:

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separating application logic into models (data), views (UI), and controllers (business logic).
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access layer to work with the data store.
- **Dependency Injection**: Passing dependencies into modules rather than hard coding them.
- **Middleware Pattern**: Using Express middleware to handle cross-cutting concerns.  

## Best Practices
The application will follow these best practices:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before production code to drive implementation.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically building and testing code changes.
- **Code Reviews**: Having code reviewed by peers before merging to main branch.  
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and logging across all layers.
- **Security**: Following security best practices like sanitizing inputs and encrypting passwords.
- **Documentation**: Maintaining updated documentation for all components.
- **Environment Configuration**: Separating environment configurations from codebase.

This high-level specification covers the major architectural decisions, patterns, and practices for the test application. Further details for each component will be documented separately.
