# Specification

## Overview

This document specifies the requirements for a FastAPI REST API service that provides user authentication, data models, API features, and comprehensive testing. The service will be built using Python and the FastAPI web framework, along with other popular libraries and tools.

## User Authentication

### JWT Token-based Authentication

The API service will implement JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication for user authentication and authorization. JWT tokens will be used to securely transmit user information between the client and the server.

#### User Registration and Login Endpoints

The API will provide the following endpoints for user registration and login:

- `/register` (POST): This endpoint will allow new users to register by providing their email and password. The password will be securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
- `/login` (POST): This endpoint will allow registered users to authenticate by providing their email and password. Upon successful authentication, a JWT token will be generated and returned to the client.

### Password Hashing with bcrypt

User passwords will be securely hashed using the bcrypt algorithm before being stored in the database. This will ensure that even if the database is compromised, the plain-text passwords will not be exposed.

### Token Refresh Mechanism

To enhance security and prevent token expiration issues, the API will implement a token refresh mechanism. When a JWT token expires, the client can request a new token by providing a refresh token. The refresh token will have a longer expiration time than the access token.

## Data Models

### User Model

The API will have a `User` model that represents a registered user. The `User` model will have the following attributes:

- `id` (UUID): A unique identifier for the user.
- `email` (string): The user's email address, which will be used as the primary identifier for authentication.
- `password` (string): The securely hashed password for the user.
- `first_name` (string): The user's first name.
- `last_name` (string): The user's last name.
- `created_at` (datetime): The timestamp when the user account was created.
- `updated_at` (datetime): The timestamp when the user account was last updated.

### SQLAlchemy ORM Integration

The API will use SQLAlchemy as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library to interact with the database. SQLAlchemy will provide a high-level abstraction for database operations, making it easier to manage the data models and perform CRUD operations.

### SQLite Database for Storage

For simplicity and portability, the API will use an SQLite database for storing user data. SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database that is easy to set up and distribute with the application.

### Pydantic Schemas for Request/Response Validation

The API will use Pydantic, a data validation and parsing library, to define request and response schemas. These schemas will ensure that the API inputs and outputs are validated against predefined data models, improving data integrity and providing clear error messages when invalid data is received.

## API Features

### OpenAPI Documentation

The API will provide interactive documentation using the OpenAPI specification. This documentation will be automatically generated based on the API endpoints and data models, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with the API.

### Input Validation using Pydantic

As mentioned earlier, the API will use Pydantic for input validation. Pydantic schemas will be defined for all API endpoints, ensuring that the incoming requests are validated against the expected data models before being processed.

### Proper Error Handling with Status Codes

The API will implement proper error handling by returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for different error scenarios. This will help clients better understand and handle errors that may occur during API interactions.

### Rate Limiting for API Endpoints

To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage, the API will implement rate limiting for certain endpoints. Rate limiting rules will be defined based on the expected usage patterns and resource constraints.

### CORS Middleware Configuration

The API will be configured with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware to handle cross-origin requests. This will allow the API to be accessed from different domains, enabling integration with various client applications.

## Testing

### Unit Tests for All Endpoints

The API will have comprehensive unit tests for all endpoints, ensuring that each endpoint behaves as expected under different input conditions and edge cases.

### Integration Tests with Test Database

In addition to unit tests, the API will have integration tests that simulate real-world scenarios by interacting with a test database. These tests will ensure that the API functions correctly when integrated with the database and other components.

### Test Fixtures and Helpers

To streamline the testing process and improve maintainability, the API will include test fixtures and helper functions. These fixtures and helpers will be used to set up test data, mock external dependencies, and perform common testing tasks.

### 100% Code Coverage Target

The API will aim for 100% code coverage, ensuring that every line of code is exercised by at least one test case. This high level of code coverage will increase confidence in the API's correctness and reliability.
