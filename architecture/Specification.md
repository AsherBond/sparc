# Specification

## User Authentication

### JWT Token-based Authentication

The application will implement JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication for securing API endpoints. JWTs will be used to transmit information between the client and server in a secure and stateless manner.

The JWT flow will work as follows:

1. The client sends user credentials (email and password) to the server.
2. The server verifies the credentials and generates a JWT containing user information (e.g., user ID, email, and any other relevant claims).
3. The server sends the JWT back to the client.
4. For subsequent requests, the client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header.
5. The server verifies the JWT and grants or denies access to the requested resource.

The JWT will be signed using a secret key stored securely on the server. The expiration time for the JWT will be configurable.

### User Registration and Login Endpoints

The application will provide the following endpoints for user registration and login:

- `POST /register`: Endpoint for user registration. It will accept user information (email, password, and other profile details) and create a new user in the database after hashing the password.
- `POST /login`: Endpoint for user login. It will accept user credentials (email and password) and return a JWT upon successful authentication.

### Password Hashing with bcrypt

User passwords will be securely hashed using the `bcrypt` library before storing them in the database. Bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed to be computationally expensive, making it resistant to brute-force attacks.

### Token Refresh Mechanism

To mitigate the risk of token theft or expiration, the application will implement a token refresh mechanism. Upon successful authentication, the server will issue two tokens:

1. **Access Token**: A short-lived token (e.g., 15 minutes) used for accessing protected resources.
2. **Refresh Token**: A long-lived token (e.g., 7 days) used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.

The client will store both tokens securely (e.g., in an HTTP-only cookie or secure storage). When the access token expires, the client will use the refresh token to request a new access token from the server without requiring user credentials.

## Data Models

### User Model

The application will have a `User` model representing user information. The model will include the following fields:

- `id` (UUID): Unique identifier for the user.
- `email` (string): User's email address (unique).
- `password` (string): Hashed user password.
- `first_name` (string): User's first name.
- `last_name` (string): User's last name.
- `created_at` (datetime): Timestamp of user creation.
- `updated_at` (datetime): Timestamp of last user update.

### SQLAlchemy ORM Integration

The application will use SQLAlchemy as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library to interact with the database. SQLAlchemy provides a high-level abstraction over the database, allowing developers to write Python code instead of raw SQL queries.

### SQLite Database

For development and testing purposes, the application will use an SQLite database for data storage. SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database that is easy to set up and requires no separate server process.

In a production environment, the application can be configured to use a more robust database management system (DBMS) like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

### Pydantic Schemas

The application will use Pydantic for data validation and serialization/deserialization. Pydantic models will be defined for request and response payloads, ensuring that the data received and sent by the API conforms to the expected structure and types.

## API Features

### OpenAPI Documentation

The application will provide interactive API documentation using the OpenAPI specification (formerly known as Swagger). This documentation will provide a user-friendly interface for exploring and testing the available endpoints, request/response payloads, and authentication mechanisms.

### Input Validation with Pydantic

As mentioned earlier, Pydantic models will be used for validating incoming request data. This validation will ensure that the API endpoints receive well-formed data, reducing the risk of errors and security vulnerabilities.

### Proper Error Handling with Status Codes

The API will implement proper error handling by returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. This will improve the developer experience by providing clear feedback on what went wrong and how to fix it.

### Rate Limiting for API Endpoints

To prevent abuse and protect the server from excessive load, the application will implement rate limiting for API endpoints. Rate limiting will be configurable and can be adjusted based on the application's requirements.

### CORS Middleware Configuration

The application will include Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware to handle cross-origin requests. CORS configuration will be customizable to allow or restrict access from specific origins.

## Testing

### Unit Tests for All Endpoints

The application will have comprehensive unit tests for all API endpoints, covering various scenarios and edge cases. Unit tests will be written using the `pytest` framework and will ensure the correct behavior of individual components and functions.

### Integration Tests with Test Database

In addition to unit tests, the application will have integration tests that exercise the entire application stack, including the database. These tests will use a separate test database to avoid modifying the development or production data.

### Test Fixtures and Helpers

To facilitate testing, the application will include test fixtures and helper functions. Fixtures will be used to set up test data and environments, while helpers will provide utility functions for common testing tasks.

### 100% Code Coverage Target

The application will aim for 100% code coverage, ensuring that all lines of code are executed and tested during the test suite run. Code coverage reports will be generated to track and improve test coverage over time.

## WebSocket Features

### Real-time Bidirectional Communication

The application will implement WebSocket functionality to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server. This will allow for efficient data exchange without the overhead of traditional HTTP requests.

### Connection Management and Heartbeat

The application will manage WebSocket connections, including establishing, maintaining, and closing connections. A heartbeat mechanism will be implemented to detect and handle disconnections gracefully.

### Message Serialization/Deserialization

Messages exchanged over WebSocket connections will be serialized and deserialized using a suitable format (e.g., JSON). Pydantic models can be used for message validation and serialization/deserialization.

### Room/Channel Support for Group Messaging

The application will support the concept of rooms or channels, allowing clients to join and leave different groups for group messaging. Each room will have its own set of connected clients and message history.

### Client Connection State Tracking

The application will maintain a record of connected clients and their respective connection states (e.g., active, inactive, disconnected). This information can be used for various purposes, such as broadcasting messages to specific clients or managing user presence.

### Reconnection Handling

The application will implement mechanisms for handling client reconnections. When a client reconnects after a disconnection, the application will ensure that the client can seamlessly resume communication and receive any missed messages.

### Message Queuing and Delivery Guarantees

Depending on the application's requirements, the application may implement message queuing and delivery guarantees. This can involve storing messages in a queue or database and ensuring reliable delivery to clients, even in the event of disconnections or server restarts.

### WebSocket Authentication Middleware

The application will include authentication middleware for WebSocket connections. This middleware will verify the client's authentication credentials (e.g., JWT) before allowing access to WebSocket functionality.

### Rate Limiting for WebSocket Connections

Similar to API rate limiting, the application will implement rate limiting for WebSocket connections to prevent abuse and protect the server from excessive load.

### Error Handling and Connection Recovery

The application will implement robust error handling and connection recovery mechanisms for WebSocket connections. This will ensure that clients can gracefully handle errors and recover from disconnections or other issues.
