# SPARC Architecture Documentation

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
   - Set up a new Node.js project using `npm init`
   - Install required dependencies (e.g., Express.js for web server)

2. **Core Services**
   - Create an Express.js application instance
   - Define routes for the home page (`/`) and about page (`/about`)
   - Render HTML templates or serve static files for each route

3. **Data Layer**
   - No database is required for a basic website with static content
   - If needed, create a separate module for data access and manipulation

4. **API Endpoints**
   - No API endpoints are required for a basic static website
   - If needed, define routes for API endpoints and handle HTTP requests

5. **Testing**
   - Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha)
   - Write unit tests for core functionality (e.g., route handlers)
   - Implement integration tests for the entire application

## Error Handling

1. **Validation**
   - Implement input validation for any user-provided data
   - Use middleware functions to validate request parameters and body

2. **Authentication**
   - No authentication is required for a basic static website
   - If needed, implement authentication and authorization mechanisms

3. **Database Errors**
   - No database errors are expected for a static website without a database
   - If a database is used, handle database connection errors and query failures

4. **Global Error Handlers**
   - Create a global error handling middleware to catch and handle uncaught exceptions
   - Log errors and return appropriate error responses to the client

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for individual components and functions
   - Test route handlers, middleware functions, and utility modules
   - Use test mocking and stubbing for dependencies

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Create integration tests to test the application as a whole
   - Test the application's behavior by simulating HTTP requests and verifying responses
   - Use a testing framework like Supertest for Express.js applications

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Implement performance tests to measure the application's response times and throughput
   - Use tools like Apache JMeter or k6 to simulate load and measure performance metrics

4. **Security Tests**
   - Perform security testing to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities
   - Test for common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection)
   - Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite for security testing

## Performance Considerations

1. **Query Optimization**
   - No database queries are involved in a basic static website
   - If a database is used, optimize queries by indexing, denormalizing, and caching

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implement caching for static assets (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript files)
   - Use in-memory caching or a caching service like Redis for dynamic content

3. **Resource Management**
   - Optimize resource usage (e.g., memory, CPU) by implementing proper error handling and resource cleanup
   - Use tools like `node-heapdump` or `node-clinic` to detect and fix memory leaks

4. **Monitoring**
   - Implement monitoring and logging for the application
   - Use tools like PM2 or Kubernetes for process management and monitoring
   - Integrate with monitoring services like Datadog, New Relic, or Prometheus
