# Architecture.md
Sure, here's a detailed software architecture for a project following the SPARC (Scalable, Portable, Available, Resilient, and Consistent) framework principles:

## System Components

### Core Services

1. **User Service**: Responsible for managing user authentication, authorization, and user-related operations.
2. **Product Service**: Handles product management, including CRUD operations, product catalogs, and inventory management.
3. **Order Service**: Manages the order lifecycle, including cart management, order placement, and order tracking.
4. **Payment Service**: Facilitates payment processing, handles payment gateways, and manages payment-related operations.
5. **Notification Service**: Handles notifications and communication with users, such as order confirmations, shipping updates, and promotional messages.

### Data Layer

1. **User Database**: Stores user information, credentials, and user-related data.
2. **Product Database**: Stores product catalogs, inventory data, and product metadata.
3. **Order Database**: Stores order data, including order details, shipping information, and order history.
4. **Payment Database**: Stores payment-related data, such as transaction records and payment gateway configurations.

### External Integrations

1. **Payment Gateway**: Integrates with third-party payment providers for secure payment processing.
2. **Shipping Provider**: Integrates with shipping carriers to facilitate order shipping and tracking.
3. **Email Service Provider**: Integrates with email service providers for sending notifications and transactional emails.
4. **Analytics Service**: Integrates with analytics platforms for tracking user behavior, product performance, and business metrics.

## Component Interactions

### Service Communication

The core services communicate with each other using a lightweight and efficient messaging system, such as Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ. This ensures loose coupling, scalability, and fault tolerance. Services can publish and consume messages asynchronously, enabling event-driven architectures and decoupled communication.

### Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**: User requests are received by the appropriate service (e.g., User Service for authentication, Order Service for order placement) and validated for correctness and security.
2. **Data Transformation**: Services transform the input data into the required format for further processing or storage.
3. **Service Interaction**: Services communicate with each other as needed, exchanging data and coordinating tasks through messaging or API calls.
4. **Data Storage**: Relevant data is persisted in the appropriate databases using efficient storage patterns and data access layers.
5. **External Integration**: Services interact with external systems, such as payment gateways and shipping providers, to fulfill specific requirements.
6. **Response Generation**: Services generate appropriate responses, which may include data retrieval from databases or external systems, and return them to the client or other services.

### API Contracts

Well-defined API contracts govern the communication between services and external clients. These contracts are typically defined using API specification formats like OpenAPI (Swagger) or API Blueprint. Services expose RESTful APIs, allowing clients to interact with the system using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and JSON or XML payloads.

## Key Design Decisions

### Technology Choices

- **Programming Language**: TypeScript (Node.js) or Go
- **Web Framework**: Express.js (Node.js) or Gin (Go)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Messaging System**: Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ
- **Caching**: Redis or Memcached
- **API Gateway**: Kong or Nginx
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, and Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK) stack

### Architectural Patterns

- **Microservices Architecture**: The system is decomposed into small, independent, and loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business capability.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate asynchronously through events, enabling loose coupling and scalability.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: The system is organized around business domains, with each service encapsulating a specific domain model and bounded context.
- **API Gateway Pattern**: An API gateway acts as a single entry point for external clients, providing API composition, routing, and security.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Services implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures and improve system resilience.
- **Caching Pattern**: Caching is employed at various levels (client-side, server-side, and distributed) to improve performance and reduce load on databases.
- **Saga Pattern**: Long-running transactions spanning multiple services are coordinated using the Saga pattern, ensuring data consistency and rollback capabilities.

### Security Measures

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement industry-standard authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and OAuth 2.0.
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest (in databases) and in transit (over the network) using strong encryption algorithms and secure key management.
- **API Security**: Implement API keys, rate limiting, and other security measures to protect APIs from abuse and unauthorized access.
- **Secure Communication**: Enforce HTTPS and TLS for all communication channels, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
- **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logging to track user actions, system events, and potential security incidents.
- **Secure Deployment**: Follow secure deployment practices, including secure container configurations, network isolation, and regular security updates.
