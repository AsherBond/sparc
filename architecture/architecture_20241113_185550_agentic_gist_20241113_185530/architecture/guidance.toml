# Architecture.md
Sure, I can provide a detailed software architecture for a project following the SPARC (Scalable, Portable, Adaptive, Resilient, and Composable) framework principles. Here's a comprehensive overview:

## System Components

### Core Services

1. **API Gateway**: The entry point for all external requests, responsible for routing, authentication, and load balancing.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Contains the core application logic, enforcing business rules and orchestrating data flow.
3. **Messaging System**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between services using a message queue or event-driven architecture.
4. **Caching Layer**: Improves performance by caching frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the data layer.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Collects and analyzes application logs, metrics, and traces for observability and debugging.

### Data Layer

1. **Database**: The primary data store, typically a relational database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB.
2. **Data Access Layer**: Abstracts the database interactions and provides a consistent interface for data access.
3. **Search Engine**: Provides full-text search capabilities, often using a dedicated search engine like Elasticsearch or Solr.
4. **File Storage**: Handles file uploads, storage, and retrieval, leveraging object storage services like Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage.

### External Integrations

1. **Third-Party APIs**: Integrates with external APIs for additional functionality or data sources.
2. **Identity Provider**: Handles user authentication and authorization, often using an external identity provider like Auth0 or Okta.
3. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users or other systems, typically via email, SMS, or push notifications.
4. **Analytics Service**: Collects and analyzes application usage data for insights and reporting.

## Component Interactions

### Service Communication

The core services communicate with each other using an event-driven architecture facilitated by the messaging system. Services publish events to the message queue, and other services subscribe to these events and react accordingly. This decoupled communication pattern promotes scalability and resilience by reducing direct dependencies between services.

### Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**: The API Gateway receives incoming requests, performs authentication, and routes them to the appropriate service in the Business Logic Layer.
2. **Business Logic Execution**: The Business Logic Layer processes the request, enforces business rules, and interacts with the Data Layer and External Integrations as needed.
3. **Data Transformation**: The Data Access Layer handles data transformations, mapping between domain models and database schemas.
4. **Data Storage and Retrieval**: The Data Access Layer interacts with the Database, Search Engine, and File Storage to persist and retrieve data.
5. **Response Generation**: The Business Logic Layer generates the appropriate response and sends it back to the API Gateway for delivery.

### API Contracts

Well-defined API contracts govern the communication between services and external clients. These contracts are typically defined using OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications, ensuring consistent and documented interfaces.

## Data Flow

### Input Processing

1. **Request Validation**: Incoming requests are validated against the API contract to ensure data integrity and prevent malformed inputs.
2. **Authentication and Authorization**: The API Gateway authenticates and authorizes requests using the Identity Provider.
3. **Request Transformation**: Requests are transformed from the external format (e.g., JSON) to the internal domain model format.

### Data Transformation

1. **Domain Model Mapping**: The Data Access Layer maps between the domain models and the database schemas, handling any necessary data transformations.
2. **Data Denormalization**: For read-heavy scenarios, data may be denormalized and stored in a format optimized for querying, such as Elasticsearch or a NoSQL database.

### Storage Patterns

1. **Database Sharding**: For large datasets, the Database may be horizontally partitioned (sharded) across multiple nodes to improve scalability and performance.
2. **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached in the Caching Layer to reduce the load on the Database and improve response times.
3. **File Storage**: Large binary data, such as images or documents, is stored in the File Storage system, with metadata and references stored in the Database.

## Key Design Decisions

### Technology Choices

- **Programming Language**: TypeScript for its type safety, tooling, and compatibility with modern JavaScript frameworks.
- **Web Framework**: Express.js or Nest.js for building the API Gateway and core services.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for its robustness, SQL support, and extensive tooling ecosystem.
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka for reliable and scalable messaging.
- **Caching**: Redis or Memcached for in-memory caching.
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch for full-text search and analytics capabilities.
- **File Storage**: Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage for scalable and durable file storage.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection and visualization, and Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stack for log aggregation and analysis.

### Architectural Patterns

- **Microservices Architecture**: The application is decomposed into small, independent services that communicate through well-defined APIs and messaging patterns.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate using an event-driven approach, decoupling them from each other and promoting scalability and resilience.
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: The core application logic is isolated from external dependencies, promoting testability and maintainability.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: The application is modeled around the business domain, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and promoting a shared understanding of the domain.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: For complex domains or high-performance scenarios, the application may separate the read and write models, optimizing each for its respective use case.

### Security Measures

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement industry-standard authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth 2.0, and integrate with an external Identity Provider.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming data against the API contract to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest (in the database) and in transit (over the network) using industry-standard encryption algorithms and protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL).
- **API Gateway Security**: Implement rate limiting, IP whitelisting, and other security measures at the API Gateway level to protect against DDoS attacks and other threats.
- **Secure Headers**: Set appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., X-XSS-Protection, X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy) to mitigate common web application vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update third-party dependencies to address security vulnerabilities and bugs.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents and breaches.
