- `src/`: Contains the source code for the CLI application.
  - `commands/`: Implements the various CLI commands (e.g., `init`, `deploy`).
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and modules (e.g., configuration, logging).
- `tests/`: Contains the test suite.
  - `unit/`: Unit tests for individual modules and functions.
  - `integration/`: Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios.
- `docs/`: Documentation for the project.
- `.github/workflows/`: GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.
- Configuration files: `.editorconfig`, `.eslintrc.json`, `.gitignore`.
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage instructions.

## Development Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Install Node.js and npm (or a package manager of your choice).
   - Set up a development environment for Supabase and the necessary services (e.g., PostgreSQL, Edge Functions).
   - Configure the project dependencies by running `npm install`.

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Implement the core CLI commands (e.g., `init`, `deploy`) in the `src/commands/` directory.
   - Develop utility functions and modules in the `src/utils/` directory.
   - Follow best practices for code organization, modularity, and reusability.

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for individual modules and functions in the `tests/unit/` directory.
   - Create integration tests for end-to-end scenarios in the `tests/integration/` directory.
   - Set up a CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run the test suite on every commit or pull request.

4. **Documentation**
   - Document the project setup, usage, and CLI commands in the `docs/` directory.
   - Update the `README.md` file with an overview of the project and installation/usage instructions.

5. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Configure the project for production deployment (e.g., minification, tree-shaking).
   - Set up a CD workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to deploy the CLI to a package registry or distribution platform.

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**
  - Test individual functions and modules in isolation.
  - Cover different input scenarios, edge cases, and error handling.
  - Ensure code coverage meets a defined threshold (e.g., 80%).

- **Integration Tests**
  - Test end-to-end scenarios involving multiple components and services.
  - Simulate real-world usage and ensure the CLI commands work as expected.
  - Test the integration with Supabase and other required services.

- **Performance Tests**
  - Measure the performance of critical operations (e.g., deployments, database interactions).
  - Identify and address potential performance bottlenecks.
  - Ensure the CLI meets defined performance requirements.

- **Security Tests**
  - Perform static code analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
  - Test for common security issues (e.g., input validation, authentication/authorization).
  - Ensure sensitive data (e.g., API keys, credentials) is properly handled and secured.

## Deployment Considerations

- **Environment Configuration**
  - Define and document the required environment variables and configuration settings.
  - Provide examples or templates for different deployment environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

- **Dependencies**
  - Ensure all dependencies are properly listed and versioned in the `package.json` file.
  - Consider using a package lock file (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) for deterministic installations.

- **Monitoring**
  - Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track the CLI's usage and performance.
  - Integrate with monitoring tools or services (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) for error tracking and alerting.

- **Maintenance**
  - Establish a process for handling bug reports, feature requests, and security vulnerabilities.
  - Plan for regular updates and releases to address issues and introduce new features or improvements.
