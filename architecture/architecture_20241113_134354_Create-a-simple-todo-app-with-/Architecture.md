# Todo App Architecture (React)

## System Components

The Todo App built with React will consist of the following main components:

1. **User Interface (UI) Components**
   - `App` (Root component)
   - `TodoList`
   - `TodoItem`
   - `TodoForm`

2. **State Management**
   - React Context API or a state management library like Redux

3. **Data Layer**
   - Local storage (browser) for persisting todo data

4. **Utilities**
   - Helper functions for data manipulation, formatting, etc.

## Component Interactions

The component interactions and data flow in the Todo App will follow the unidirectional data flow pattern promoted by React.

1. The `App` component will serve as the root component and will manage the application state using either the React Context API or a state management library like Redux.

2. The `TodoList` component will receive the list of todos from the application state and render individual `TodoItem` components for each todo.

3. The `TodoItem` component will display the todo text and provide functionality to mark the todo as complete or delete it.

4. The `TodoForm` component will allow users to input new todo items, which will be added to the application state.

5. When the application state changes (e.g., adding a new todo, marking a todo as complete, or deleting a todo), the relevant UI components will re-render to reflect the updated state.

## Data Flow

The data flow in the Todo App will follow the principles of React's unidirectional data flow:

1. **Input Processing**: User interactions (e.g., adding a new todo, marking a todo as complete, deleting a todo) will trigger events or function calls.

2. **State Updates**: These events or function calls will update the application state managed by the React Context API or the state management library (e.g., Redux).

3. **Data Transformation**: If needed, helper functions or utilities will be used to transform or manipulate the data before updating the state.

4. **State Propagation**: The updated state will be propagated down to the relevant UI components through props or the Context API.

5. **Rendering**: The UI components will re-render based on the updated state, reflecting the changes in the user interface.

6. **Persistence**: The todo data will be persisted in the browser's local storage, allowing the app to retain the data even after a page refresh or browser closure.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Technology Choices**:
   - React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering with the Virtual DOM.
   - React Context API or Redux: For managing application state and providing a centralized way to share data across components.
   - Local Storage: For persisting todo data on the client-side, eliminating the need for a server-side data store in this simple application.

2. **Architectural Patterns**:
   - Component-based Architecture: React promotes a modular and reusable component-based architecture, making it easier to develop, maintain, and test individual components.
   - Unidirectional Data Flow: React's unidirectional data flow pattern simplifies state management and makes it easier to reason about data changes in the application.

3. **Security Measures**:
   - Input Validation: Implement client-side input validation to prevent potential security risks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
   - Sanitize User Input: Sanitize user input before storing or displaying it to mitigate potential security risks.
   - Secure Local Storage: Implement measures to secure local storage data, such as encrypting sensitive information or using secure storage mechanisms provided by modern browsers.

- `src/components/`: Contains the main React components for the Todo App.
  - `App.js`: The root component that manages the application state and renders the other components.
  - `TodoList/`: A folder containing the `TodoList` and `TodoItem` components.
    - `TodoList.js`: A component that renders a list of `TodoItem` components based on the todo data from the application state.
    - `TodoItem.js`: A component that represents a single todo item, displaying its text and providing functionality to mark it as complete or delete it.
  - `TodoForm/`: A folder containing the `TodoForm` component.
    - `TodoForm.js`: A component that allows users to input new todo items and adds them to the application state.
- `src/contexts/`: Contains the context providers and consumers for managing application state (if using React Context API).
  - `TodoContext.js`: A context provider and consumer for managing the todo data and related state.
- `src/utils/`: Contains helper functions and utilities for data manipulation or formatting.
  - `helpers.js`: A file containing utility functions for tasks like filtering, sorting, or formatting todo data.
