# Todo App Specification

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a simple and user-friendly Todo application using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The Todo app will allow users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks and activities efficiently.

### Target Audience

The primary target audience for this Todo app includes individuals who need to organize their daily tasks, prioritize their workload, and stay productive. This could include students, professionals, freelancers, or anyone looking for a simple and effective tool to manage their to-do lists.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Task Creation**
   - Users should be able to create new tasks by entering a task description.
   - The task description should have a character limit (e.g., 100 characters) to promote concise task descriptions.

2. **Task Listing**
   - The application should display a list of all existing tasks.
   - Each task should be represented by its description and a checkbox to mark it as complete or incomplete.

3. **Task Completion**
   - Users should be able to mark a task as complete by checking the corresponding checkbox.
   - Completed tasks should be visually distinguished from incomplete tasks (e.g., strike-through text, different color, or a separate section).

4. **Task Deletion**
   - Users should be able to delete tasks they no longer need.
   - A confirmation prompt should be displayed before deleting a task to prevent accidental deletions.

5. **Task Editing**
   - Users should be able to edit the description of an existing task.
   - The edited task should update in the task list without creating a new entry.

6. **Task Filtering**
   - Users should be able to filter tasks based on their completion status (e.g., show only completed tasks, only incomplete tasks, or all tasks).

7. **Task Sorting**
   - Users should be able to sort tasks based on their creation date or completion status.

8. **Persistent Data Storage**
   - The application should store task data locally (e.g., using the browser's local storage or IndexedDB) to persist tasks across browser sessions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **User Experience**
   - The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface.
   - The UI should follow best practices for usability and accessibility.
   - The application should provide clear feedback and error messages when necessary.

2. **Performance**
   - The application should have minimal load times and respond quickly to user interactions.
   - Rendering and updating the task list should be optimized for large numbers of tasks.

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
   - The application should function consistently across modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

4. **Responsive Design**
   - The application should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

5. **Security**
   - The application should not store or transmit any sensitive user data.
   - Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other potential security vulnerabilities.

3. **Third-Party Libraries**
   - The use of third-party libraries and packages is permitted, but they should be well-documented and widely adopted.
   - Any third-party libraries used should be thoroughly evaluated for security vulnerabilities and compatibility.

4. **Local Data Storage**
   - The application will use the browser's local storage or IndexedDB for storing task data locally.
   - No server-side storage or synchronization will be implemented in this phase of the project.

5. **Scope**
   - The application will focus on the core functionality of creating, managing, and tracking tasks.
   - Advanced features like user authentication, task sharing, or integration with other services are out of scope for this phase.

# Architecture.md
# Todo App Architecture (React)

## System Components

The Todo App built with React will consist of the following main components:

1. **User Interface (UI) Components**
   - `App` (Root component)
   - `TodoList`
   - `TodoItem`
   - `TodoForm`

2. **State Management**
   - React Context API or a state management library like Redux

3. **Data Layer**
   - Local storage (browser) for persisting todo data

4. **Utilities**
   - Helper functions for data manipulation, formatting, etc.

## Component Interactions

The component interactions and data flow in the Todo App will follow the unidirectional data flow pattern promoted by React.

1. The `App` component will serve as the root component and will manage the application state using either the React Context API or a state management library like Redux.

2. The `TodoList` component will receive the list of todos from the application state and render individual `TodoItem` components for each todo.

3. The `TodoItem` component will display the todo text and provide functionality to mark the todo as complete or delete it.

4. The `TodoForm` component will allow users to input new todo items, which will be added to the application state.

5. When the application state changes (e.g., adding a new todo, marking a todo as complete, or deleting a todo), the relevant UI components will re-render to reflect the updated state.

## Data Flow

The data flow in the Todo App will follow the principles of React's unidirectional data flow:

1. **Input Processing**: User interactions (e.g., adding a new todo, marking a todo as complete, deleting a todo) will trigger events or function calls.

2. **State Updates**: These events or function calls will update the application state managed by the React Context API or the state management library (e.g., Redux).

3. **Data Transformation**: If needed, helper functions or utilities will be used to transform or manipulate the data before updating the state.

4. **State Propagation**: The updated state will be propagated down to the relevant UI components through props or the Context API.

5. **Rendering**: The UI components will re-render based on the updated state, reflecting the changes in the user interface.

6. **Persistence**: The todo data will be persisted in the browser's local storage, allowing the app to retain the data even after a page refresh or browser closure.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Technology Choices**:
   - React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering with the Virtual DOM.
   - React Context API or Redux: For managing application state and providing a centralized way to share data across components.
   - Local Storage: For persisting todo data on the client-side, eliminating the need for a server-side data store in this simple application.

2. **Architectural Patterns**:
   - Component-based Architecture: React promotes a modular and reusable component-based architecture, making it easier to develop, maintain, and test individual components.
   - Unidirectional Data Flow: React's unidirectional data flow pattern simplifies state management and makes it easier to reason about data changes in the application.

3. **Security Measures**:
   - Input Validation: Implement client-side input validation to prevent potential security risks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
   - Sanitize User Input: Sanitize user input before storing or displaying it to mitigate potential security risks.
   - Secure Local Storage: Implement measures to secure local storage data, such as encrypting sensitive information or using secure storage mechanisms provided by modern browsers.
