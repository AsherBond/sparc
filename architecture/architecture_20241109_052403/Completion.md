Completion Criteria:

1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Define the core features and functionalities the application should provide.
   - Specify the user roles and their associated permissions.
   - Outline the expected user interactions and flows.
   - Describe the data models and their relationships.
   - Identify any integration points with external systems or APIs.

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - Define performance and scalability requirements (e.g., response times, throughput, load handling).
   - Outline security and data protection requirements (e.g., authentication, authorization, data encryption).
   - Specify availability and reliability targets (e.g., uptime, failover mechanisms).
   - Determine maintainability and extensibility goals.
   - Identify any specific compliance or regulatory requirements.

3. **Technical Constraints**:
   - Specify the target deployment environments (e.g., cloud, on-premises).
   - Identify any technology stack or platform constraints.
   - Outline any third-party dependencies or integrations.
   - Define any compatibility requirements (e.g., browser support, device support).

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance**:
   - Establish test coverage targets (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests).
   - Define acceptance criteria for manual testing.
   - Outline the testing environments and data setup requirements.
   - Specify any performance testing or load testing requirements.

5. **Documentation and Training**:
   - Identify the required technical documentation (e.g., architecture diagrams, API documentation, deployment guides).
   - Determine the need for user documentation or training materials.
   - Define any knowledge transfer or handover activities.

6. **Deployment and Operations**:
   - Outline the deployment processes and environments (e.g., staging, production).
   - Specify monitoring and logging requirements.
   - Define backup and disaster recovery strategies.
   - Identify any operational support or maintenance requirements.
