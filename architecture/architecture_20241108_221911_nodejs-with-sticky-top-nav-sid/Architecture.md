# Software Architecture Documentation

## System Components

### 1. Core Services

**Next.js Application**
- This is the main application built with the Next.js framework, which serves as the front-end and handles server-side rendering (SSR).
- It includes components for the sticky navigation, sidebar, mobile view, and agent management system.

**API Server**
- A separate Node.js server that handles API requests and integrates with the data layer and external services.
- Responsible for processing and responding to API calls from the Next.js application.

**Authentication Service**
- Handles user authentication and authorization.
- Integrates with the data layer to manage user accounts and permissions.

### 2. Data Layer

**Database**
- A database management system (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store application data, such as user information, agent details, and other relevant data.

**Object Storage**
- A cloud-based object storage service (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) to store and serve static assets like images, documents, and media files.

### 3. External Integrations

**Third-Party Services**
- Integrations with external services or APIs may be required for specific features or functionality, such as payment gateways, messaging services, or analytics platforms.

**Logging and Monitoring**
- Integration with a logging and monitoring service (e.g., Datadog, New Relic) to track application performance, errors, and usage metrics.

## Component Interactions

### 1. Service Communication

- The Next.js application communicates with the API server via HTTP requests (e.g., REST, GraphQL) to fetch data and perform operations.
- The API server interacts with the data layer (database and object storage) to retrieve, store, or update data as needed.
- The API server may also communicate with external services or APIs to integrate with third-party functionality.

### 2. Data Flow

- User interactions in the Next.js application (e.g., form submissions, button clicks) trigger API requests to the API server.
- The API server processes the requests, interacts with the data layer, and responds with the appropriate data or actions.
- The Next.js application receives the response data and updates the user interface accordingly.

### 3. API Contracts

- Clear and well-documented API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI, GraphQL schema) define the communication between the Next.js application and the API server.
- These contracts specify the available endpoints, request/response formats, and data structures.

## Data Flow

### 1. Input Processing

- User input from forms, buttons, or other UI elements in the Next.js application is collected and validated on the client-side.
- Valid input data is then sent to the API server via HTTP requests.
- The API server performs additional input validation and sanitization to ensure data integrity and security.

### 2. Data Transformation

- The API server may need to transform or manipulate data before storing or retrieving it from the data layer.
- This could involve data normalization, aggregation, or formatting to match the application's data models.

### 3. Storage Patterns

- For structured data (e.g., user accounts, agent details), a relational or document-based database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) can be used.
- For unstructured or binary data (e.g., images, documents), an object storage service (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) can be utilized.
- Appropriate indexing and caching strategies should be implemented to optimize data retrieval and application performance.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Technology Choices

- **Next.js**: A popular React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and other features out of the box, making it suitable for building modern web applications with excellent performance and developer experience.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows for building efficient and scalable server-side applications, making it a good choice for the API server.
- **MongoDB or PostgreSQL**: Depending on the data structure and requirements, either a document-based database (MongoDB) or a relational database (PostgreSQL) can be used for storing structured application data.
- **Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage**: Reliable and scalable object storage services for storing and serving static assets like images, documents, and media files.

### 2. Architectural Patterns

- **Microservices Architecture**: The application is divided into separate services (Next.js application, API server, authentication service) that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, promoting modularity and flexibility.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Certain components or services (e.g., API server, authentication service) can be deployed as serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) to take advantage of automatic scaling, reduced operational overhead, and pay-per-use pricing models.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Certain features or workflows (e.g., background tasks, notifications) can be implemented using an event-driven approach, where events are published to a message queue (e.g., AWS SQS, RabbitMQ) and processed asynchronously by dedicated workers or serverless functions.

### 3. Security Measures

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth) to protect user accounts and sensitive data.
- **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all user input on both the client-side (Next.js application) and server-side (API server) to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
- **Encrypted Communication**: Use HTTPS for secure communication between the Next.js application, API server, and external services.
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality based on user roles and permissions.
- **Regular Security Audits and Updates**: Regularly audit the application for security vulnerabilities and keep all dependencies and libraries up to date with the latest security patches.
