# NodeJS Management System with SQLite

## System Components

### Core Services

1. **API Gateway**: This component acts as the entry point for all incoming requests. It handles request validation, authentication, and routing to the appropriate service.

2. **User Management Service**: Responsible for handling user-related operations such as authentication, authorization, and user profile management.

3. **Resource Management Service**: Manages various resources within the system, such as projects, tasks, documents, etc.

4. **Notification Service**: Handles the delivery of notifications to users, either through email, push notifications, or other channels.

5. **Audit Service**: Logs and tracks important system events for auditing and compliance purposes.

### Data Layer

1. **SQLite Database**: The primary data store for the application, responsible for persisting and retrieving data.

2. **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) Layer**: Provides an abstraction over the SQLite database, allowing developers to interact with data using domain-specific models and queries.

### External Integrations

1. **Email Service Provider**: Integrates with a third-party email service provider to send transactional emails (e.g., notifications, password resets).

2. **Push Notification Service**: Integrates with a third-party push notification service to deliver real-time notifications to mobile devices.

## Component Interactions

### Service Communication

The core services communicate with each other using a lightweight messaging system or an event bus. This allows for loose coupling and asynchronous communication between services.

1. **API Gateway**: Receives incoming requests and forwards them to the appropriate service based on the request path and method.

2. **User Management Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization requests, and provides user data to other services as needed.

3. **Resource Management Service**: Interacts with the User Management Service to validate user permissions and access control. It also interacts with the Notification Service to send notifications related to resource updates.

4. **Notification Service**: Receives notification requests from other services and delivers them to users via appropriate channels (email, push notifications).

5. **Audit Service**: Listens to events from other services and logs relevant data for auditing purposes.

### Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**: Incoming requests are validated and processed by the API Gateway before being forwarded to the appropriate service.

2. **Data Transformation**: Services may transform data between different formats (e.g., from request payloads to domain models) before persisting or processing it.

3. **Storage Patterns**: The ORM layer provides an abstraction over the SQLite database, allowing services to interact with data using domain-specific models and queries. Common patterns like the Repository pattern or the Unit of Work pattern can be employed for data access and management.

## Key Design Decisions

### Technology Choices

- **Node.js**: A popular JavaScript runtime for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimalistic and flexible web application framework for Node.js, used for building the API Gateway and other HTTP-based services.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, file-based relational database management system, chosen for its simplicity and ease of deployment.
- **ORM (e.g., Sequelize, TypeORM)**: An Object-Relational Mapping library that provides an abstraction over the SQLite database, allowing developers to work with domain models instead of raw SQL queries.

### Architectural Patterns

- **Microservices Architecture**: The system is decomposed into small, independent services that communicate with each other using lightweight messaging or an event bus. This promotes loose coupling, scalability, and maintainability.
- **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**: This architectural pattern separates the application core from external dependencies, promoting testability and flexibility in swapping out external components.
- **Repository Pattern**: Used in conjunction with the ORM layer to abstract data access logic and provide a consistent interface for querying and persisting data.

### Security Measures

- **Authentication and Authorization**: The User Management Service handles user authentication (e.g., using JSON Web Tokens) and authorization based on roles and permissions.
- **Input Validation**: The API Gateway and other services validate incoming requests to prevent common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data, such as user passwords, should be encrypted before storage using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., bcrypt for password hashing).
- **Audit Logging**: The Audit Service logs relevant system events for auditing and compliance purposes, helping to detect and investigate potential security incidents.
- **Secure Communication**: All communication between services and external integrations should be encrypted using TLS/SSL to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

```

- **`src/api-gateway`**: Contains the API Gateway implementation, including routes, middleware, and other related files.
- **`src/services`**: Contains the implementation of various services, such as user management, resource management, notification, and audit services.
- **`src/database`**: Contains database-related files, including models, migrations, and seeders.
- **`src/shared`**: Contains shared utilities, constants, and other reusable code.
- **`src/config`**: Contains configuration files for various components, such as database connection settings and service configurations.
- **`app.js`**: The entry point of the application, responsible for setting up and running the server.

Each service folder (`src/services/*`) typically contains the following structure:

- **`controllers`**: Handles incoming requests, validates input, and coordinates with other components to perform the requested operation.
- **`models`**: Defines the domain models and their relationships.
- **`repositories`**: Implements the Repository pattern for abstracting data access logic and providing a consistent interface for querying and persisting data.

The `src/database` folder contains the following:

- **`models`**: Defines the database models and their relationships using the ORM.
- **`migrations`**: Contains database migration scripts for creating and modifying database tables.
- **`seeders`**: Contains scripts for seeding the database with initial or test data.

This structure follows the principle of separating concerns and promotes maintainability, testability, and extensibility of the codebase.
