  - **api.md**: API documentation for the WebSocket server and client.
- **.env**: Environment configuration file.
- **deno.jsonc**: Deno project configuration file.
- **import_map.json**: Import map for managing dependencies.
- **README.md**: Project overview and setup instructions.

### Development Steps

1. **Environment setup**
   - Install Deno and any required dependencies.
   - Configure the development environment (e.g., editor, debugger).

2. **Core implementation**
   - Implement the WebSocket server using Deno's built-in WebSocket module.
   - Implement the WebSocket client using Deno's built-in WebSocket module.
   - Implement any required utility functions and helpers.
   - Define type definitions for better code maintainability.

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for the WebSocket server and client using Deno's built-in testing framework.
   - Write integration tests to ensure the server and client work together as expected.

4. **Documentation**
   - Document the project architecture and design decisions.
   - Document the API for the WebSocket server and client.
   - Update the README file with project overview and setup instructions.

5. **Deployment preparation**
   - Optimize the application for production deployment (e.g., code minification, tree shaking).
   - Configure the production environment (e.g., server settings, environment variables).
   - Prepare deployment scripts or instructions.

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit tests**
  - Test individual functions and modules in isolation.
  - Cover edge cases and error handling.
  - Maintain high code coverage (e.g., 80% or higher).

- **Integration tests**
  - Test the interaction between the WebSocket server and client.
  - Simulate real-world scenarios and use cases.
  - Test message exchange, connection handling, and error scenarios.

- **Performance tests**
  - Test the application's performance under various load conditions.
  - Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
  - Identify and address performance bottlenecks.

- **Security tests**
  - Test for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation, authentication, authorization).
  - Ensure proper handling of untrusted data and user input.
  - Test for potential WebSocket-specific security issues (e.g., denial of service, cross-site scripting).

### Deployment Considerations

- **Environment configuration**
  - Set up the production environment with the required dependencies and configurations.
  - Configure environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials).

- **Dependencies**
  - Manage dependencies using Deno's built-in module system or a package manager (e.g., deno.land/x).
  - Ensure dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with the production environment.

- **Monitoring**
  - Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track application health and performance.
  - Set up alerts and notifications for critical events and errors.

- **Maintenance**
  - Establish a process for regularly updating dependencies and applying security patches.
  - Plan for future upgrades and migrations (e.g., Deno version updates).
