# Deno.js WebSocket Application Architecture

## System Components

1. **Core Services**
   - WebSocket Server: Handles WebSocket connections, message broadcasting, and client management.
   - WebSocket Client: Establishes WebSocket connections with the server and facilitates real-time communication.
   - Message Handler: Processes incoming messages, validates data, and dispatches events or actions.
   - Event Emitter: Emits events based on specific conditions or actions, allowing for decoupled communication between components.

2. **Data Layer**
   - Data Storage: Manages the storage and retrieval of application data (e.g., in-memory, database, or file system).
   - Data Access Layer: Provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the data storage component.

3. **External Integrations**
   - Authentication Service: Handles user authentication and authorization.
   - Logging Service: Logs application events and errors for monitoring and debugging purposes.
   - Notification Service: Sends real-time notifications to clients or external systems.

## Component Interactions

1. **Service Communication**
   - The WebSocket Server and WebSocket Client components establish a real-time communication channel using the WebSocket protocol.
   - The Message Handler component receives messages from the WebSocket Server and processes them accordingly.
   - The Event Emitter component emits events based on specific conditions or actions, which can be consumed by other components.
   - The Data Access Layer component interacts with the Data Storage component to perform CRUD operations on application data.

2. **Data Flow**
   - Client-side: The WebSocket Client sends messages to the WebSocket Server, which are then processed by the Message Handler.
   - Server-side: The Message Handler processes incoming messages, validates data, and dispatches events or actions based on the message content.
   - The Event Emitter component emits events based on specific conditions or actions, which can trigger further processing or data updates.
   - The Data Access Layer component interacts with the Data Storage component to persist or retrieve application data as needed.

3. **API Contracts**
   - WebSocket Protocol: The WebSocket Server and WebSocket Client components communicate using the WebSocket protocol, which defines the message format and handshake process.
   - Message Format: The Message Handler component expects incoming messages to conform to a specific format (e.g., JSON) for proper processing.
   - Event Contracts: The Event Emitter component emits events with predefined names and payloads, which other components can subscribe to and handle accordingly.
   - Data Access Contracts: The Data Access Layer component provides a consistent interface for interacting with the Data Storage component, defining methods for CRUD operations and data formats.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Technology Choices**
   - Deno.js: A modern, secure, and performant runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, designed to address some of the limitations of Node.js.
   - WebSocket Protocol: Chosen for its real-time, bidirectional communication capabilities, enabling efficient data transfer between clients and the server.
   - In-memory Data Storage (or Database): Depending on the application requirements, data can be stored in-memory for simplicity or in a database for persistence and scalability.

2. **Architectural Patterns**
   - Event-driven Architecture: The application follows an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events emitted by the Event Emitter component.
   - Separation of Concerns: The application is divided into logical components with distinct responsibilities, promoting code modularity and maintainability.

3. **Security Measures**
   - Authentication and Authorization: The Authentication Service component ensures secure user authentication and authorization, protecting sensitive data and functionality.
   - Input Validation: The Message Handler component validates incoming messages to prevent malicious or invalid data from being processed.
   - Secure WebSocket Connections: WebSocket connections can be secured using TLS/SSL encryption to protect data in transit.
