**Technical Specification: Distraction-Free Mobile Application**

**1. Overview**

This document outlines the technical requirements and implementation details for developing a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter. The app aims to help users minimize distractions by restricting access to selected applications during designated focus periods.

**2. System Requirements**

- **Development Environment**:
  - **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 Pro (64-bit) or macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later.
  - **Hardware**: Minimum 8 GB RAM; 16 GB recommended.
  - **Storage**: At least 52 GB of free space; SSD recommended.
  - **Tools**: Flutter SDK, Android Studio, Xcode (for iOS development), and compatible code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

- **Target Platforms**:
  - **Android**: Version 5.0 (Lollipop) and above.
  - **iOS**: Version 10.0 and above.

**3. Permissions and Platform-Specific Implementations**

- **Android**:
  - **Permissions**:
    - `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`: To monitor app usage.
    - `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`: To display overlay screens.
    - `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`: To restart services after device reboot.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Utilize Accessibility Services to detect and block selected apps.
    - Implement background services to monitor app launches.
    - Use method channels to integrate native Android code with Flutter.

- **iOS**:
  - **Permissions**:
    - `Screen Time` API access: To manage and restrict app usage.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Leverage the Screen Time API to set app restrictions.
    - Implement necessary entitlements in the app's provisioning profile.

**4. Key Features and Implementation Details**

- **App Selection**:
  - Provide a list of installed apps for users to select which ones to block during focus sessions.
  - **Implementation**:
    - On Android, retrieve the list of installed apps using the `PackageManager` class.
    - On iOS, access the list of installed apps through the Screen Time API.

- **Focus Sessions**:
  - **Manual Mode**: Allow users to start a focus session instantly.
  - **Scheduled Mode**: Enable users to schedule recurring focus periods.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Manage session timing within the Flutter app.
    - Trigger app blocking mechanisms at the start of a session and release them at the end.

- **Usage Analytics**:
  - Track and display app usage statistics to help users identify distracting apps.
  - **Implementation**:
    - On Android, use the `UsageStatsManager` to collect app usage data.
    - On iOS, utilize the Screen Time API to gather usage information.

- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Allow users to configure essential apps that remain accessible during focus sessions.
  - Enable customization of break periods between focus sessions.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Store user preferences locally using Flutter's `shared_preferences` package.

- **Notifications**:
  - Send reminders for upcoming focus sessions and notify users when a session starts or ends.
  - **Implementation**:
    - Use Flutter's `flutter_local_notifications` package to schedule and display notifications.

**5. Architecture and State Management**

- **Architecture**:
  - Implement a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to separate UI from business logic.
  - Organize the project into layers: UI, ViewModel, Repository, and Services.

- **State Management**:
  - Use the `flutter_bloc` package to manage application state and facilitate communication between UI and business logic components.

**6. Platform Channels for Native Integration**

- **Purpose**:
  - Facilitate communication between Flutter and native platform code to access platform-specific features.

- **Implementation**:
  - Define method channels in Flutter to invoke native code for app blocking functionalities.
  - Implement corresponding native code in Kotlin (for Android) and Swift (for iOS) to handle method calls.

**7. Sample Code Snippets**

- **Android Native Code Integration**:
  - In `MainActivity.kt`, set up a method channel to communicate with Flutter:

    ```kotlin
    class MainActivity: FlutterActivity() {
        private val CHANNEL = "com.example.app/usage"

        override fun configureFlutterEngine(flutterEngine: FlutterEngine) {
            super.configureFlutterEngine(flutterEngine)
            MethodChannel(flutterEngine.dartExecutor.binaryMessenger, CHANNEL).setMethodCallHandler {
                call, result ->
                if (call.method == "getInstalledApps") {
                    val apps = getInstalledApps()
                    result.success(apps)
                } else {
                    result.notImplemented()
                }
            }
        }

        private fun getInstalledApps(): List<String> {
            // Implementation to retrieve installed apps
        }
    }
    ```

- **Flutter Dart Code**:
  - Invoke the method channel to retrieve installed apps:

    ```dart
    static const platform = MethodChannel('com.example.app/usage');

    Future<List<String>> _getInstalledApps() async {
      try {
        final List<dynamic> apps = await platform.invokeMethod('getInstalledApps');
        return apps.cast<String>();
      } on PlatformException catch (e) {
        print("Failed to get installed apps: '${e.message}'.");
        return [];
      }
    }
    ```
