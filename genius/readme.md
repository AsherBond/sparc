This project aims to develop a Project Management and Control Processes Tracking Software to ensure the monitoring of project stakeholders, including investor representatives and consultancy service providers in Solar Power Plant (SPP) projects, within the scope of authority and responsibility given by the investor. The software will begin by creating user interfaces that allow contractors, investors, and consultancy stakeholders to effectively monitor processes.
