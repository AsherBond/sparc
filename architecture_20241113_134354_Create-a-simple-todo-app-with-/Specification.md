# Todo App Specification

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a simple and user-friendly Todo application using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The Todo app will allow users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks and activities efficiently.

### Target Audience

The primary target audience for this Todo app includes individuals who need to organize their daily tasks, prioritize their workload, and stay productive. This could include students, professionals, freelancers, or anyone looking for a simple and effective tool to manage their to-do lists.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Task Creation**
   - Users should be able to create new tasks by entering a task description.
   - The task description should have a character limit (e.g., 100 characters) to promote concise task descriptions.

2. **Task Listing**
   - The application should display a list of all existing tasks.
   - Each task should be represented by its description and a checkbox to mark it as complete or incomplete.

3. **Task Completion**
   - Users should be able to mark a task as complete by checking the corresponding checkbox.
   - Completed tasks should be visually distinguished from incomplete tasks (e.g., strike-through text, different color, or a separate section).

4. **Task Deletion**
   - Users should be able to delete tasks they no longer need.
   - A confirmation prompt should be displayed before deleting a task to prevent accidental deletions.

5. **Task Editing**
   - Users should be able to edit the description of an existing task.
   - The edited task should update in the task list without creating a new entry.

6. **Task Filtering**
   - Users should be able to filter tasks based on their completion status (e.g., show only completed tasks, only incomplete tasks, or all tasks).

7. **Task Sorting**
   - Users should be able to sort tasks based on their creation date or completion status.

8. **Persistent Data Storage**
   - The application should store task data locally (e.g., using the browser's local storage or IndexedDB) to persist tasks across browser sessions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **User Experience**
   - The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface.
   - The UI should follow best practices for usability and accessibility.
   - The application should provide clear feedback and error messages when necessary.

2. **Performance**
   - The application should have minimal load times and respond quickly to user interactions.
   - Rendering and updating the task list should be optimized for large numbers of tasks.

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
   - The application should function consistently across modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

4. **Responsive Design**
   - The application should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

5. **Security**
   - The application should not store or transmit any sensitive user data.
   - Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other potential security vulnerabilities.

## Constraints and Assumptions

1. **Development Environment**
   - The application will be developed using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
   - The development environment will include modern tooling and libraries, such as Webpack, Babel, and ESLint.

2. **Browser Support**
   - The application should support the latest versions of major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
   - Compatibility with older browser versions or Internet Explorer is not a requirement.

3. **Third-Party Libraries**
   - The use of third-party libraries and packages is permitted, but they should be well-documented and widely adopted.
   - Any third-party libraries used should be thoroughly evaluated for security vulnerabilities and compatibility.

4. **Local Data Storage**
   - The application will use the browser's local storage or IndexedDB for storing task data locally.
   - No server-side storage or synchronization will be implemented in this phase of the project.

5. **Scope**
   - The application will focus on the core functionality of creating, managing, and tracking tasks.
   - Advanced features like user authentication, task sharing, or integration with other services are out of scope for this phase.
