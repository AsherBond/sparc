# Todo App with React

## Completion Criteria

### Project Structure

1. **Source Code Organization**
   - Follow the recommended folder structure for React applications
   - Separate components, containers, services, and utilities into their respective folders
   - Use a consistent naming convention for files and directories

2. **Configuration Files**
   - `package.json`: Manage project dependencies and scripts
   - `.env`: Store environment-specific variables (if needed)
   - `.eslintrc`: Configure linting rules for code quality
   - `.prettierrc`: Configure code formatting rules

3. **Documentation**
   - `README.md`: Provide an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines
   - Component-level documentation using JSDoc or similar commenting style

4. **Test Suite**
   - `__tests__` or `tests` directory for unit and integration tests
   - Test utilities and mocks in a separate folder

### Development Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Install Node.js and npm (or yarn)
   - Set up a new React project using Create React App or a similar tool
   - Configure code editor and extensions (e.g., ESLint, Prettier)

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Create components for the todo list, todo item, and input form
   - Implement state management (e.g., using React hooks or a state management library)
   - Add functionality to create, read, update, and delete todo items
   - Style the components using CSS or a CSS-in-JS solution

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for individual components and utilities
   - Create integration tests for user interactions and data flow
   - Set up test runners (e.g., Jest) and configure test environments

4. **Documentation**
   - Document the project structure, components, and their responsibilities
   - Provide usage examples and guidelines for developers

5. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Optimize the production build (e.g., code minification, asset optimization)
   - Configure the deployment environment (e.g., web server, hosting platform)
   - Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline

### Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components and their behavior
   - Verify prop handling, state updates, and render output
   - Mock dependencies and external services

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test user interactions and data flow across multiple components
   - Simulate user events (e.g., clicks, form submissions)
   - Verify component integration and communication

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Measure and optimize component rendering performance
   - Identify and address potential performance bottlenecks

4. **Security Tests**
   - Test for potential vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting, injection attacks)
   - Verify proper input validation and sanitization

### Deployment Considerations

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up the production environment (e.g., web server, hosting platform)
   - Configure environment variables for production settings

2. **Dependencies**
   - Ensure all project dependencies are up-to-date and compatible
   - Optimize dependencies for production builds

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up monitoring and logging tools for the production environment
   - Monitor application performance, errors, and usage metrics

4. **Maintenance**
   - Establish a process for regular security updates and bug fixes
   - Plan for future enhancements and feature releases

### Final Checklist

- [ ] All unit and integration tests are passing
- [ ] Documentation is complete and up-to-date
- [ ] Security review has been conducted, and vulnerabilities have been addressed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks have been met, and optimizations have been applied
- [ ] Deployment environment is configured and ready for production deployment
