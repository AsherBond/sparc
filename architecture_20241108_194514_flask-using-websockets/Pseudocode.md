Sure, here's the pseudocode for key components of Flask using WebSockets:

## Core Classes/Functions

```python
# Flask Application
class FlaskApp:
    def __init__(self, name):
        # Initialize Flask app
        self.app = Flask(name)
        self.socket_io = SocketIO(self.app)
        self.configure_app()
        self.configure_websockets()

    def configure_app(self):
        # Configure Flask app settings

    def configure_websockets(self):
        # Configure WebSocket event handlers

# WebSocket Connection Manager
class ConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connections = {}

    def add_connection(self, sid, data):
        # Add a new WebSocket connection

    def remove_connection(self, sid):
        # Remove an existing WebSocket connection

    def broadcast(self, data):
        # Broadcast data to all connected clients

# WebSocket Event Handlers
def on_connect():
    # Handle new WebSocket connection

def on_disconnect():
    # Handle WebSocket disconnection

def on_message(data):
    # Handle incoming WebSocket message
```

## Important Algorithms

```python
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    # Authenticate user credentials
    # Return user data if valid, else return error

def process_message(message):
    # Process incoming message data
    # Perform necessary operations
    # Return processed data

def handle_event(event_type, data):
    # Handle specific event types
    # Dispatch event to appropriate handlers
    # Return response data
```

## Data Structures

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, username, email, password):
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
        self.password = password

class Message:
    def __init__(self, sender, recipient, content, timestamp):
        self.sender = sender
        self.recipient = recipient
        self.content = content
        self.timestamp = timestamp

class Event:
    def __init__(self, type, data):
        self.type = type
        self.data = data
```

In this pseudocode, we have the following key components:

1. **FlaskApp**: This class represents the Flask application and handles the initialization, configuration, and setup of the WebSocket functionality using the `SocketIO` library.

2. **ConnectionManager**: This class manages the active WebSocket connections, allowing you to add, remove, and broadcast data to connected clients.

3. **WebSocket Event Handlers**: These functions handle various WebSocket events such as connecting, disconnecting, and receiving messages.

4. **Important Algorithms**: These functions include user authentication, message processing, and event handling.

5. **Data Structures**: These represent the data models for users, messages, and events.

Note that this pseudocode provides a high-level overview of the key components and may need to be adapted based on your specific requirements and implementation details.
