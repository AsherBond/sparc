# Specification

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive specification document for the project.

## Research and Analysis
- Use tools like Perplexity to gather information on various approaches, architectures, and relevant technical papers.
- Document findings in markdown files, including pros and cons of different approaches.

## Project Overview
- Elaborate on the project goal, providing context and background.
- Describe the target audience and their needs, including demographics and user personas.

## Functional Requirements
- List and describe each functional requirement.
- Break down complex features into smaller, manageable components.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Detail each non-functional requirement, explaining its importance.
- Include performance metrics, security standards, and scalability considerations.

## User Scenarios and User Flows
- Describe typical user scenarios and provide user flow diagrams.
- Include step-by-step interactions and decision points.

## UI/UX Considerations
- Discuss UI/UX guidelines and include design sketches if applicable.
- Reference design principles and accessibility standards.

## File Structure Proposal
- Suggest an organized file and directory structure.
- Use markdown files to outline and guide the process.

## Assumptions
