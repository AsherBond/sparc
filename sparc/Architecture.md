# Architecture

## System Overview
The SPARC GUI is a Streamlit-based graphical interface for the SPARC CLI tool, providing an intuitive way to interact with the SPARC framework.

## Core Components

### Component: MainApp
- Handles overall application structure and routing
- Manages session state and configuration
- Controls navigation flow
- Initializes theme/styling
- Sets up sidebar navigation

### Component: ProjectManager
- Manages project initialization and configuration
- Handles file operations and project structure
- Controls project settings and preferences
- Manages Git integration and version control
- Tracks project status and history

### Component: UIComponents
- Custom Streamlit components and widgets
- Progress indicators and status displays
- File browsers and editors
- Navigation elements
- Modal dialogs and notifications

### Component: CodeEditor
- Code editing interface with syntax highlighting
- File browser and navigation
- Save/load operations
- Version control integration
- Search and replace functionality

### Component: TestRunner
- Test execution interface
- Test results display and reporting
- Coverage analysis and visualization
- Error handling and logging
- Test history tracking

### Component: SettingsManager
- User preferences management
- Theme configuration
- Project settings
- API key management
- Path configurations

### Component: GitIntegration
- Repository status display
- Commit interface
- Branch management
- History visualization
- Merge operations

## Data Flow
1. User interacts with MainApp interface
2. ProjectManager handles file/project operations
3. UIComponents render interface elements
4. CodeEditor manages code modifications
5. TestRunner executes and reports tests
6. SettingsManager maintains configuration
7. GitIntegration handles version control

## Security Considerations
- API key storage and encryption
- Secure file operations
- Access control
- Input validation
- Error handling

## Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of components
- Caching strategies
- Efficient state management
- Resource optimization
- Background processing

## Error Handling
- Graceful error recovery
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging and monitoring
- Debug information
- Error reporting

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components
- Integration testing
- End-to-end testing
- Performance testing
- Security testing

## Deployment
- Environment configuration
- Dependency management
- Container support
- CI/CD integration
- Monitoring setup
