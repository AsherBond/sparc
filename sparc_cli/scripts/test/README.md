# SPARC Autonomous Development System

This directory contains a suite of test scripts that demonstrate SPARC's capabilities as an autonomous development system. Built on fly.io, this system represents a new paradigm in software development - one where the system can design, implement, evaluate, and improve itself with minimal human intervention.

## Core Capabilities

### Self-Programming
The system can:
- Analyze requirements and design solutions
- Generate complete, working code implementations
- Create tests and documentation
- Refactor and optimize code automatically
- Learn from its own development process

### Self-Evaluation
The system continuously:
- Monitors its own performance
- Identifies areas for improvement
- Analyzes code quality and patterns
- Measures success against objectives
- Generates detailed evaluation reports

### Self-Improvement
Through autonomous learning, the system:
- Evolves its architecture based on results
- Optimizes its algorithms and patterns
- Adapts to changing requirements
- Implements better solutions iteratively
- Maintains its own codebase

### Self-Deployment
The system manages its own lifecycle:
- Handles deployment configurations
- Manages cloud resources
- Implements scaling strategies
- Monitors production performance
- Executes rollbacks when needed

## Autonomous Operation

Each script demonstrates a different aspect of autonomous development:

1. **Initial Development**
   - Analyzes requirements
   - Designs solution architecture
   - Implements core functionality
   - Creates necessary infrastructure

2. **Continuous Evolution**
   - Monitors performance metrics
   - Identifies improvement opportunities
   - Implements optimizations
   - Updates documentation

3. **Self-Management**
   - Handles resource allocation
   - Manages dependencies
   - Implements security measures
   - Maintains system health

4. **Learning & Adaptation**
   - Learns from execution patterns
   - Adapts to changing conditions
   - Improves decision making
   - Optimizes resource usage

## Usage

Each script can be run independently:

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x script_name.sh

# Run script
./script_name.sh
```

The scripts will:
1. Create a new fly.io app with a unique name
2. Deploy necessary dependencies
3. Run SPARC with specific prompts
4. Clean up resources automatically

## Requirements

- fly.io CLI installed and configured
- SPARC CLI installed
- Valid API keys in config.sh
- Internet connection for dependency installation

## Common Features

All scripts include:
- Interactive menu system
- Automatic dependency installation
- Error handling and cleanup
- Progress monitoring
- Resource management
- Detailed logging
