# Mixture of Reflection (MoR) Model in Rust

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive specification for implementing the Mixture of Reflection (MoR) model using Rust. The MoR model combines Mixture of Experts (MoE) with reflection-based reasoning to enable specialized, self-correcting models capable of complex problem-solving tasks.

## Project Overview

The MoR model aims to enhance problem-solving capabilities by integrating expert modules with reflection logic. It is designed to handle complex tasks by leveraging specialized experts and iterative reasoning.

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The MoR model consists of several key components:
- **Embedding Layer**: Transforms input tokens into dense vector representations.
- **Expert Selector**: Determines the probability distribution over experts for each input.
- **Reflection Modules (Experts)**: Specialized modules that perform iterative reasoning on inputs.
- **Integration Layer**: Combines outputs from all experts based on their selection probabilities.

### Components Description

- **Embedding Layer**
  - *Purpose*: Transform input tokens into dense vector representations.
  - *Implementation Details*: Uses an embedding matrix initialized randomly.
  
- **Expert Selector**
  - *Purpose*: Determines the probability distribution over experts for each input.
  - *Implementation Details*: Consists of linear layers with ReLU activation and softmax output.

- **Reflection Modules (Experts)**
  - *Purpose*: Specialized modules that perform iterative reasoning on inputs.
  - *Implementation Details*: Each expert is a neural network module with specified depth and layers.

- **Integration Layer**
  - *Purpose*: Combines outputs from all experts based on their selection probabilities.
  - *Implementation Details*: Implements a weighted sum and a final linear transformation.

### Data Flow

Data flows through the system from input to output, with each component processing and transforming the data as needed.

## Data Handling

- **Data Format**: The model expects input data in a specific format, with each sample consisting of input features and corresponding targets.
- **Data Loading**: The `ExampleDataLoader` is responsible for loading and batching data for training and evaluation.
- **Preprocessing Steps**: Data is preprocessed to ensure compatibility with the model's input requirements.

### EmbeddingLayer

```rust
pub struct EmbeddingLayer {
    // Fields
}

impl EmbeddingLayer {
    pub fn new(vs: &nn::Path, vocab_size: i64, embedding_dim: i64) -> Self;
    pub fn forward(&self, input: &Tensor) -> Tensor;
}
```

**Description**: Converts token indices into embeddings.

### ExpertSelector

```rust
pub struct ExpertSelector {
    // Fields
}

impl ExpertSelector {
    pub fn new(vs: &nn::Path, input_dim: i64, hidden_dim: i64, num_experts: i64) -> Self;
    pub fn forward(&self, input: &Tensor) -> Tensor;
}
```

**Description**: Outputs a probability distribution over experts for each input.

## Configuration

The model uses a JSON configuration file (`config.json`) with the following structure:

```json
{
    "learning_rate": 0.001,
    "batch_size": 32,
    "reflection_depth": 3,
    "num_experts": 5,
    "max_epochs": 10,
    "data_path": "data/",
    "model_save_path": "model.pt"
}
```

**Parameters**:

- **learning_rate**: Learning rate for the optimizer.
- **batch_size**: Number of samples per training batch.
- **reflection_depth**: Depth of reasoning in the reflection modules.
- **num_experts**: Number of expert modules in the model.
- **max_epochs**: Number of training epochs.
- **data_path**: Path to the training data.
- **model_save_path**: File path to save the trained model.
