- Integration tests for combined components and services
- End-to-end tests for the complete application (optional)

## Development Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Install Node.js and npm (or yarn)
   - Set up the project structure
   - Initialize the project with `npm init vite@latest`
   - Install required dependencies (e.g., Vue, Vue Router, Vuex, etc.)

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Implement the sticky top navigation bar component
   - Implement the sidebar component
   - Implement the agent list and agent details components
   - Implement the mobile menu component
   - Set up routing with Vue Router
   - Implement the agent management view
   - Implement the dashboard view
   - Integrate API services and data fetching logic
   - Implement state management (if needed)

3. **Testing**
   - Set up the testing framework (e.g., Jest, Vitest)
   - Write unit tests for components and utility functions
   - Write integration tests for combined components and services
   - Write end-to-end tests for the complete application (optional)

4. **Documentation**
   - Document the project setup and installation process
   - Document the project structure and file organization
   - Document the usage of components and services
   - Document the testing process and test suite

5. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Configure the production build process
   - Optimize the application for production (e.g., code minification, tree-shaking)
   - Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines (optional)

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components for correct rendering and behavior
- Test utility functions for expected outputs and edge cases
- Ensure adequate code coverage for components and utility functions

### Integration Tests
- Test combined components and services for correct interaction and data flow
- Test API service integration with mock or real API endpoints
- Test state management integration (if using a state management library)

### Performance Tests (Optional)
- Test application performance under various load conditions
- Identify and address performance bottlenecks

### Security Tests (Optional)
- Test for common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- Ensure proper input validation and sanitization

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Configuration
- Set up the production environment
- Configure environment variables for production (if needed)
- Configure web server or hosting platform (e.g., Nginx, Apache, cloud hosting)

### Dependencies
- Ensure all production dependencies are installed and up-to-date
- Consider using a package lock file (e.g., `package-lock.json`) for consistent dependency versions

### Monitoring
- Set up monitoring and logging for the production environment
- Monitor application performance, errors, and resource usage

### Maintenance
- Establish a process for applying updates and bug fixes
- Plan for regular security updates and dependency upgrades
