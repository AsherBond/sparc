# Development Conventions

This document outlines the conventions to be followed during the development process using the SPARC framework. These conventions ensure consistency, clarity, and efficiency throughout the project lifecycle.

## General Guidelines

- **Documentation**: Use markdown files to document each step of the SPARC process. Ensure clarity and thoroughness in all explanations.
- **Reflection**: At each stage, include a reflection section to discuss decisions, alternatives, and justifications.
- **Tools**: Utilize tools like Perplexity for research and AIDER.chat for rapid development and integration.

## SPARC Framework Steps

### 1. Specification
- Develop a comprehensive specification document.
- Include detailed content, user scenarios, and UI/UX considerations.
- Propose an organized file structure.

### 2. Pseudocode
- Translate specifications into high-level pseudocode.
- Organize pseudocode in markdown files with inline comments.

### 3. Architecture
- Define system architecture and technical design.
- Choose appropriate architectural styles and justify choices.
- Document system architecture diagrams and technology stack.

### 4. Refinement
- Iteratively improve architecture and pseudocode.
- Optimize for efficiency and maintainability.

### 5. Completion
- Finalize the project ensuring readiness for deployment.
- Perform extensive testing and prepare deployment plans.

## Coding Standards

- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Code Comments**: Include comments to explain complex logic and code blocks.
- **Version Control**: Commit changes frequently with descriptive messages.

## Collaboration

- **Communication**: Maintain open communication with team members.
- **Feedback**: Regularly review and provide feedback on each other's work.

## Conclusion

Adhering to these conventions will ensure a smooth and efficient development process, leveraging the SPARC framework to achieve project goals effectively.
