PRD
Current State
We are currently in the problem definition phase. We have to send Baxter an updated PRD stating our understanding of the problem and proposing a solution.
Scope
This project aims to develop an AI-driven solution to enhance Baxter International's ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) data collection, analysis, and reporting processes. The scope includes creating an automated tool for scraping ESG data from public reports of Baxter and its competitors, implementing NLP models for data extraction and processing, and developing a standardized ESG dataset for improved comparability. The project will also deliver AI-powered insights and visualizations through a user-friendly dashboard, allowing real-time querying and report generation. The solution will improve efficiency by reducing manual effort, enhancing data accuracy, and providing actionable insights for better decision-making. The project aims to be completed in 7 weeks, with key deliverables including the data collection tool, standardized dataset, AI-driven insights, comparative ESG reports, and actionable recommendations for ESG improvement. The scope does not include overhauling Baxter's ESG strategy or developing custom AI tools from scratch.
Problem Statement
Problem Solution summary: This project aims to streamline Baxter International’s ability to compare and report its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance against peer competitors using AI-driven automation tools. The solution will focus on improving the efficiency of ESG data collection, analysis, and comparison, ultimately enhancing transparency and allowing Baxter to communicate its ESG progress better.
Baxter International currently faces challenges in efficiently gathering and comparing its ESG performance data with its peers. The manual processes are time-consuming, and comparisons are not easily aligned with competitor benchmarks. This lack of streamlined data hinders Baxter’s ability to report ESG progress effectively and make data-driven decisions that improve performance relative to the industry. 
Key Issues:
Manual Effort: Baxter’s ESG data collection and reporting processes are primarily manual, leading to inefficiency.
Comparability: Current ESG data lacks direct comparability to peer companies due to inconsistent metrics and formats.
AI Utilization: Baxter aims to explore AI tools for automating these processes but has yet to implement such solutions.

Appendix
Business Context
Baxter International seeks to improve how it automates collecting and generating insights from Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports. The current process of manually gathering and comparing ESG data is inefficient and lacks consistency, especially when dealing with competitors who use different metrics, scales, and methodologies. With increasing attention on ESG performance from stakeholders and investors, Baxter requires a more streamlined and AI-powered rubric to assess its position relative to its competitors.

Additionally, challenges arise in comparing ESG scores due to inconsistent scales and metrics across the industry. This complexity is further compounded by questions surrounding the reliability, cadence, and storage of data used in ESG evaluations. To address these challenges, the company aims to develop a tool that automates data collection and offers real-time insights to help Baxter compare its performance with industry leaders, thereby supporting its goal of carbon neutrality with a 25% reduction by 2030 and complete neutrality by 2040.
General Context
Several vital stakeholders and considerations influence this project:
Olga Selina (Senior Sponsor) is invested in creating something Baxter can publicly promote and showcase, mainly highlighting the company's forward-thinking approach to ESG and its relationship with Northwestern University.
Kelly Mowalvi appears to be more concerned with the tangible outcomes and the real value the project brings, particularly the actionable insights from the ESG comparisons.
Megan Lum is Baxter's Global ESG and EHS executive leader. Like Kelly, she is more concerned with the tangible outcomes and actionable insights from the ESG comparisons. In particular, she is concerned with comparing how Baxter utilizes Water compared to competitors as part of the environmental goals.
Reuven Cohen is focused on fostering the relationship between Baxter and Northwestern while exploring innovative technologies that can benefit both the company and the university.

There has been internal discussion regarding Baxter’s decision to sell its kidney care business and how this move might influence its ESG goals. The impact on ESG targets like carbon neutrality remains to be seen, and it raises the need for a model that can assess the outcomes of specific actions on Baxter’s overall ESG performance.
ESG Challenges
Baxter’s product portfolio spans MedTech and Pharmaceuticals, which introduces complexities in comparing its environmental impact with peers. For example, Baxter’s water usage is high, particularly in the production of IV fluids, making it difficult to compare directly with MedTech competitors who may not use water in similar ways. Pharma competitors such as SNP Brown and even companies from other sectors like Miller/Coors may have more comparable water usage footprints despite operating in different industries.

The ESG project also includes discussions on recasting existing goals, particularly around water usage, which remains a significant cost for Baxter. Part of the challenge is understanding how competitors quantify their ESG goals (e.g., overall reduction percentages, risk reduction, or efficiency increases) and whether those goals apply to Baxter’s unique business model.

Key Considerations
ESG Ratings and Investor Perspectives: Baxter is particularly interested in understanding how external agencies such as MSCI and Sustainalytics rate its ESG performance and how investors perceive these ratings. Investigating the methodologies behind these ratings will help Baxter position itself better within the ESG landscape.
Impact Modeling: There is a desire to model the impact of specific business actions (e.g., divestment from the kidney business) on ESG scores and understand how these actions will affect future sustainability goals.
Client Motivations and Relationships: Olga and Ruben's overarching goal is to establish and solidify a strong relationship with Northwestern, which Baxter can showcase as a key achievement. However, Kelly's primary concern seems to be ensuring that the project’s outcome has real-world applicability and leads to actionable improvements in Baxter’s ESG strategies.
