# Refinement

## Objective
Iteratively improve the architecture and pseudocode.

## Tasks
- Review and revise pseudocode and architecture.
- Optimize algorithms for efficiency.
- Enhance code readability and maintainability.
- Update documentation to reflect changes.
- Conduct hypothetical testing scenarios to find issues.
- Use an architecture/editor model to iteratively enhance each component.
- Incorporate feedback from stakeholders and team members.

## Reflection
- Analyze feedback from hypothetical tests.
- Reflect on trade-offs made during optimization.
- Consider user feedback and potential improvements.
- Evaluate the impact of refinements on project goals and timelines.
