## Data Flow

1. User Input Flow
   - User interactions captured by UIComponents
   - Processed by MainApp
   - Dispatched to appropriate components
   - Results displayed through UIComponents

2. Project Management Flow
   - ProjectManager receives commands
   - Coordinates with GitIntegration
   - Updates file system
   - Notifies MainApp of changes

3. Testing Flow
   - TestRunner receives test requests
   - Executes test suites
   - Collects results and coverage
   - Reports back through UIComponents

4. Settings Flow
   - SettingsManager receives updates
   - Validates and stores changes
   - Notifies affected components
   - Updates UI accordingly

## Security Considerations

1. File System Access
   - Restricted to project directory
   - Validation of file operations
   - Secure file handling

2. Git Operations
   - Credential management
   - Secure repository access
   - Command validation

3. Configuration Storage
   - Secure storage of settings
   - Encryption of sensitive data
   - Access control

## Performance Optimization

1. Lazy Loading
   - Component initialization on demand
   - Resource management
   - Memory optimization

2. Caching Strategy
   - File content caching
   - Git status caching
   - UI component caching

3. Async Operations
   - Background processing
   - Non-blocking UI updates
   - Progress indication

## Error Handling

1. Component-Level Handling
   - Local error capture
   - Graceful degradation
   - User feedback

2. System-Level Handling
   - Global error boundary
   - Recovery mechanisms
   - Logging and reporting

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Testing
   - Component isolation
   - Mocked dependencies
   - Comprehensive coverage

2. Integration Testing
   - Component interaction
   - End-to-end workflows
   - System integration

3. Performance Testing
   - Load testing
   - Response time
   - Resource usage

## Deployment Considerations

1. Environment Setup
   - Dependencies management
